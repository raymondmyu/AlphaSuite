## 🧠 Adding a New Trading Strategy

The quantitative engine is designed to be modular, allowing new trading strategies to be developed and integrated by simply adding a single, self-contained Python file to the `strategies/` directory. The system automatically discovers and loads any valid strategy file at runtime.

### How It Works

The system scans the `strategies/` directory for Python files. Inside each file, it looks for a class that inherits from `pybroker_trainer.strategy_sdk.BaseStrategy`. This class encapsulates all the logic and parameters for a single strategy. Two sample strategy files are included in the repository:
ma_crossover.py is a non-ML, rule-based strategy; donchian_breakout.py is a ML-based strategy. You can use them as a reference for building your own.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Create a New File:** Create a new Python file in the `strategies/` directory. The filename should be descriptive and use snake_case (e.g., `my_awesome_strategy.py`).
2.  **Define the Strategy Class:** Inside the new file, define a class that inherits from `BaseStrategy`. The class name should be descriptive and use CamelCase (e.g., `MyAwesomeStrategy`).
3.  **Implement Required Methods:** Implement the four required methods within your class: `define_parameters`, `get_feature_list`, `add_strategy_specific_features`, and `get_setup_mask`.

### Strategy Class Breakdown

Each strategy class must implement the following methods, which define its behavior, data requirements, and entry logic.

#### 1. `define_parameters()`

This static method defines all the parameters the strategy uses, their default values, and their tuning ranges for optimization. This is critical for backtesting and hyperparameter tuning.

*   **Returns:** A dictionary where each key is a parameter name. The value is another dictionary specifying its `type`, `default` value, and a `tuning_range` tuple.

**Example from `DonchianBreakoutStrategy`:**
```python
@staticmethod
def define_parameters():
    """Defines parameters, their types, defaults, and tuning ranges."""
    return {
        'donchian_period': {'type': 'int', 'default': 20, 'tuning_range': (15, 50)},
        'atr_period': {'type': 'int', 'default': 14, 'tuning_range': (10, 30)},
        # ... other parameters
    }
```

#### 2. `get_feature_list()`

This method returns a list of all the feature (column) names that the strategy's machine learning model requires as input. The training engine uses this list to prepare the data correctly.

*   **Returns:** A `list` of strings.

**Example from `DonchianBreakoutStrategy`:**
```python
def get_feature_list(self) -> list[str]:
    """Returns the list of feature column names required by the model."""
    return [
        'roc', 'rsi', 'mom', 'ppo', 'cci',
        # ... other features
    ]
```

#### 3. `add_strategy_specific_features()`

This is where you calculate any indicators or features that are unique to your strategy and are not part of the common features provided by the system.

*   **Arguments:** A pandas `DataFrame` containing the price data and common indicators.
*   **Returns:** The modified pandas `DataFrame` with your new feature columns added.

**Example from `DonchianBreakoutStrategy`:**
```python
def add_strategy_specific_features(self, data: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Calculates and adds features unique to this specific strategy."""
    donchian_period = self.params.get('donchian_period', 20)
    data['donchian_upper'] = data['high'].rolling(window=donchian_period).max()
    data['donchian_lower'] = data['low'].rolling(window=donchian_period).min()
    data['donchian_middle'] = (data['donchian_upper'] + data['donchian_lower']) / 2
    return data
```

#### 4. `get_setup_mask()`

This is the core of your strategy's entry logic. This method must return a boolean pandas `Series` that is `True` on the bars where a potential trade setup occurs and `False` otherwise.

*   **Arguments:** A pandas `DataFrame` containing all required features (both common and strategy-specific).
*   **Returns:** A pandas `Series` of boolean values, with the same index as the input `DataFrame`.

**Example from `DonchianBreakoutStrategy`:**
```python
def get_setup_mask(self, data: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    """Returns a boolean Series indicating the bars where a trade setup occurs."""
    is_uptrend = data['trend_bullish'] == 1
    is_breakout = data['high'] > data['donchian_upper'].shift(1)
    raw_setup_mask = is_uptrend & is_breakout
    # Ensure we only signal on the first bar of a new setup
    return raw_setup_mask & ~raw_setup_mask.shift(1).fillna(False)
```

By following this structure, you can create new, complex strategies that seamlessly integrate with the project's backtesting, tuning, and training infrastructure.

## 🧠 Adding a New Scanner

AlphaSuite comes with over 20 pre-built custom scanners that are ready to use out of the box. These scanners cover a wide range of technical and fundamental patterns, from classic RSI divergences to complex Wyckoff accumulation setups. They not only provide powerful screening capabilities but also serve as excellent, practical examples for developers looking to build their own custom scanners.

The Market Scanner is also designed to be modular, allowing you to create and integrate custom scanners with minimal effort. By adding a self-contained Python file to the `scanners/` directory, the system will automatically discover and load it into the Streamlit UI.

### How It Works

The system scans the `scanners/` directory for Python files. Inside each file, it looks for a class that inherits from `scanners.scanner_sdk.BaseScanner`. This class encapsulates all the logic and parameters for a single scanner. The `generic_screener.py` is a special, built-in scanner, but any other file you add will be treated as a custom scanner.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Create a New File:** Create a new Python file in the `scanners/` directory. The filename should be descriptive and use snake_case (e.g., `my_custom_scanner.py`). The filename will be used as the scanner's unique identifier.
2.  **Define the Scanner Class:** Inside the new file, define a class that inherits from `BaseScanner`. The class name should be descriptive and use CamelCase (e.g., `MyCustomScanner`).
3.  **Implement Required Methods:** Implement the required methods within your class to define its parameters, display columns, and scanning logic.

### Scanner Class Breakdown

Each scanner class should implement the following methods to define its behavior.

#### 1. `define_parameters()`

This static method defines the parameters that will appear in the UI for your scanner. It allows users to customize the scan without changing the code.

*   **Returns:** A `list` of dictionaries, where each dictionary defines a parameter's `name`, `type` (`int`, `float`, `select`), `default` value, and `label`.

**Example from `BullishDipBounceScanner`:**
```python
@staticmethod
def define_parameters():
    return [
        {"name": "min_avg_volume", "type": "int", "default": 250000, "label": "Min. Avg. Volume"},
        {"name": "rsi_period", "type": "int", "default": 7, "label": "RSI Period"},
        {"name": "divergence_lookback", "type": "int", "default": 30, "label": "Divergence Lookback"},
    ]
```

#### 2. `get_leading_columns()`

This static method returns a list of column names that should be displayed first in the results table, ensuring the most important information is easily visible.

*   **Returns:** A `list` of strings.

**Example from `BullishDipBounceScanner`:**
```python
@staticmethod
def get_leading_columns():
    return ['symbol', 'rsi', 'divergence_date', 'longname', 'marketcap']
```

#### 3. `get_sort_info()`

This static method defines the default sorting order for the results table.

*   **Returns:** A `dict` specifying the column(s) to sort `by` and the `ascending` order.

**Example from `BullishDipBounceScanner`:**
```python
@staticmethod
def get_sort_info():
    return {'by': 'marketcap', 'ascending': False}
```

#### 4. `scan_company()`

This is the core logic of your scanner. The base framework handles filtering stocks by market, volume, and market cap, then calls this method for each remaining company. Your job is to analyze the provided data and determine if the company is a match.

*   **Arguments:**
    *   `group`: A pandas `DataFrame` containing the company's historical price data.
    *   `company_info`: A `dict` containing basic company information from the database.
*   **Returns:** The `company_info` dictionary if the stock matches the criteria (you can add new keys to it, like `divergence_date`), or `None` if it does not.

**Example from `BullishDipBounceScanner`:**
```python
def scan_company(self, group: pd.DataFrame, company_info: dict) -> dict | None:
    # ... (calculation logic for RSI, SMA, and divergence) ...

    if is_uptrend and is_lower_low_price and is_higher_rsi:
        company_info['rsi'] = float(rsi.iloc[-i])
        company_info['divergence_date'] = group['date'].iloc[-i].strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
        return company_info
    
    return None
```

For scanners with more complex requirements that don't fit the per-company iteration model (like the `StrongestIndustriesScanner`, which groups by industry first), you can override the `run_scan()` method to implement your own custom data fetching and processing logic.
