4.  **Set up the Database:**
    *   Ensure your PostgreSQL server is running.
    *   Create a new database (e.g., `alphasuite`).
    *   The application will create the necessary tables on its first run.

5.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    *   Copy the example environment file:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    *   Open the `.env` file and edit the variables:

        *   `OLLAMA_URL`: The URL for your running Ollama instance (e.g., `http://localhost:11434`). Required for `ollama`.
        *   `OLLAMA_MODEL`: The name of the model you have pulled in Ollama (e.g., `llama3`).

### 3. Usage

1.  **Initial Data Download:**
    Before running the app, you need to populate the database with market data. Run the download script from your terminal. This may take a long time for the initial run.
    ```bash
    # Download data for the US market (recommended for first run)
    python download_data.py pipeline
    ```

2.  **Run the Streamlit Web Application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run Home.py
    ```
    Open your web browser to the local URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

3.  **Follow the In-App Workflow:**
    1.  **Populate Data:** Go to the **Data Management** page and run the "Daily Pipeline" or a "Full Download".
    2.  **Scan for Signals:** Use the **Market Scanner** to find live trading signals.
    3.  **Tune & Train:** To build custom models, navigate to the **Model Training & Tuning** page.
    4.  **Analyze & Backtest:** Use the **Portfolio Analysis** page to validate your strategies.
    5.  **Deep Research:** Use the **Stock Report** page for in-depth analysis of specific stocks.

## 🧠 Adding a New Trading Strategy

The quantitative engine is designed to be modular, allowing new trading strategies to be developed and integrated by simply adding a single, self-contained Python file to the `strategies/` directory. The system automatically discovers and loads any valid strategy file at runtime.

### How It Works

The system scans the `strategies/` directory for Python files. Inside each file, it looks for a class that inherits from `pybroker_trainer.strategy_sdk.BaseStrategy`. This class encapsulates all the logic and parameters for a single strategy. Two sample strategy files are included in the repository:
ma_crossover.py is a non-ML, rule-based strategy; donchian_breakout.py is a ML-based strategy. You can use them as a reference for building your own.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Create a New File:** Create a new Python file in the `strategies/` directory. The filename should be descriptive and use snake_case (e.g., `my_awesome_strategy.py`).
2.  **Define the Strategy Class:** Inside the new file, define a class that inherits from `BaseStrategy`. The class name should be descriptive and use CamelCase (e.g., `MyAwesomeStrategy`).
3.  **Implement Required Methods:** Implement the four required methods within your class: `define_parameters`, `get_feature_list`, `add_strategy_specific_features`, and `get_setup_mask`.

### Strategy Class Breakdown

Each strategy class must implement the following methods, which define its behavior, data requirements, and entry logic.

#### 1. `define_parameters()`

This static method defines all the parameters the strategy uses, their default values, and their tuning ranges for optimization. This is critical for backtesting and hyperparameter tuning.

*   **Returns:** A dictionary where each key is a parameter name. The value is another dictionary specifying its `type`, `default` value, and a `tuning_range` tuple.

**Example from `DonchianBreakoutStrategy`:**
```python
@staticmethod
def define_parameters():
    """Defines parameters, their types, defaults, and tuning ranges."""
    return {
        'donchian_period': {'type': 'int', 'default': 20, 'tuning_range': (15, 50)},
        'atr_period': {'type': 'int', 'default': 14, 'tuning_range': (10, 30)},
        # ... other parameters
    }
```

#### 2. `get_feature_list()`

This method returns a list of all the feature (column) names that the strategy's machine learning model requires as input. The training engine uses this list to prepare the data correctly.

*   **Returns:** A `list` of strings.

**Example from `DonchianBreakoutStrategy`:**
```python
def get_feature_list(self) -> list[str]:
    """Returns the list of feature column names required by the model."""
    return [
        'roc', 'rsi', 'mom', 'ppo', 'cci',
        # ... other features
    ]
```

#### 3. `add_strategy_specific_features()`

This is where you calculate any indicators or features that are unique to your strategy and are not part of the common features provided by the system.

*   **Arguments:** A pandas `DataFrame` containing the price data and common indicators.
*   **Returns:** The modified pandas `DataFrame` with your new feature columns added.

**Example from `DonchianBreakoutStrategy`:**
```python
def add_strategy_specific_features(self, data: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Calculates and adds features unique to this specific strategy."""
    donchian_period = self.params.get('donchian_period', 20)
    data['donchian_upper'] = data['high'].rolling(window=donchian_period).max()
    data['donchian_lower'] = data['low'].rolling(window=donchian_period).min()
    data['donchian_middle'] = (data['donchian_upper'] + data['donchian_lower']) / 2
    return data
```

#### 4. `get_setup_mask()`

This is the core of your strategy's entry logic. This method must return a boolean pandas `Series` that is `True` on the bars where a potential trade setup occurs and `False` otherwise.

*   **Arguments:** A pandas `DataFrame` containing all required features (both common and strategy-specific).
*   **Returns:** A pandas `Series` of boolean values, with the same index as the input `DataFrame`.

**Example from `DonchianBreakoutStrategy`:**
```python
def get_setup_mask(self, data: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    """Returns a boolean Series indicating the bars where a trade setup occurs."""
    is_uptrend = data['trend_bullish'] == 1
    is_breakout = data['high'] > data['donchian_upper'].shift(1)
    raw_setup_mask = is_uptrend & is_breakout
    # Ensure we only signal on the first bar of a new setup
    return raw_setup_mask & ~raw_setup_mask.shift(1).fillna(False)
```

By following this structure, you can create new, complex strategies that seamlessly integrate with the project's backtesting, tuning, and training infrastructure.
